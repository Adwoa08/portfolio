                I have always had a passion for making a difference in the world. I first began taking coding courses in my home country of Ghana while I was teaching full-time. As a teacher, I loved seeing my students grow and get excited about learning. As a coder, I loved how I could see the immediate changes taking place as I wrote and edited my code. I'm also excited that now I can make a change in any part of the world, even without physically being there, as long as I have my laptop and the internet.

                I received a bachelor's degree from the University of Cape Coast in Business Administration. After coming to the US and wanting to pursue a career in web development, I decided to attend the V School web dev bootcamp where I completed over 600 hours of intensive training in Full Stack Web Development.
